Hack USU 2023

This was an entry for the 2023 Utah State CS Hackathon (HackUSU). It entered and won the "General" category.

## How to run
- Create .env folders both in the root folder and in the `client/` as shown in the .env.example files

- Run the following commands:
  - `npm install` (varies by package manager) in both root and `client/` directories
  - `npm db:migrate` in the root directory
  - `npm run start` in the `client/` directory
  - `npm run dev` in the root directory
- Go to the url as indicated from the server (in the root directory), NOT the client-side url. The back-end serves the front-end.
